# Minimal Lower Layer Protocol (MLLP) HL7 Examples
This repo contains three example projects, one in Java using Apache Camel/MINA, Spring and Maven; another using NodeJS; and a third built in .NET 6 that ports an older Framework-based project called HL7-Fuse.  All three listen for an MLLP transaction and respond with an ACK message in turn, using a variety of libraries, which are documented in each project's folder.
